                <h3>Has Sony "scrapped" Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse?</h3>
                <p>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse producer Christopher Miller has stepped in to deny that Sony
                    has “scrapped” most of the third film for creative reasons.

                    Miller was forced to post on X/Twitter after industry reporter Jeff Sneider’s InSneider
                    newsletter claimed on Monday that the highly anticipated third film in the Spider-Verse trilogy
                    “would be unlikely to debut before 2027.

                    "The InSneider report also hinted at creative differences causing some scenes to be scrapped.
                    According to Variety, it stated: “While the Beyond the Spider-Verse team was taken aback by the
                    change in direction, I’m told they’re relieved to have more time to work on the sequel, as it’s
                    important to all involved that they stick the landing on this Oscar-winning franchise.”

                    Miller, whose credits also include The Afterparty and The Mitchells vs the Machines, has been
                    quick to chime in and deny the report. On Tuesday he wrote: “Nothing has been scrapped. The
                    reels are coming along nicely.”

                    This comes after composer Daniel Pemberton also weighed in on the claims. “Don’t really ever
                    want to weigh in on this sort of stuff BUT would you ever believe there could sometimes be stuff
                    on the internet that might not always be particularly accurate? Hmmmm…” he said....
