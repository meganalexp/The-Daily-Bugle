            <h2>Spider-Verse Producer Calmly Denies Claim About Final Film That Worried Fans</h2>
            <h3>Greg Evans | Thursday 12 September 2024 04:04</h3>

                    class="float-image">

                Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse producer Christopher Miller has stepped in to deny that Sony has
                “scrapped” most of the third film for creative reasons.

                Miller was forced to post on X/Twitter after industry reporter Jeff Sneider’s InSneider newsletter
                claimed on Monday that the highly anticipated third film in the Spider-Verse trilogy “would be unlikely
                to debut before 2027.

                "The InSneider report also hinted at creative differences causing some scenes to be scrapped. According
                to Variety, it stated: “While the Beyond the Spider-Verse team was taken aback by the change in
                direction, I’m told they’re relieved to have more time to work on the sequel, as it’s important to all
                involved that they stick the landing on this Oscar-winning franchise.”

                Miller, whose credits also include The Afterparty and The Mitchells vs the Machines, has been quick to
                chime in and deny the report. On Tuesday he wrote: “Nothing has been scrapped. The reels are coming
                along nicely.”

                This comes after composer Daniel Pemberton also weighed in on the claims. “Don’t really ever want to
                weigh in on this sort of stuff BUT would you ever believe there could sometimes be stuff on the internet
                that might not always be particularly accurate? Hmmmm…” he said. Despite the critical and commercial
                success of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at
                the 96th Academy Awards, production on its predecessor has been fraught with problems.

                Reports from Vulture suggested that production had halted due to conflicts with finishing Spider-Man:
                Across the Spider-Verse. Work on the film was further delayed by the 2023 Hollywood strikes, which
                prevented voice actors from recording their dialogue.

                The same report claimed that the second film encountered problems with animators who were operating
                under unsustainable work conditions and that 100 artists, who were working 11 hours a day and seven days
                a week, had left the project.

                The franchise’s producer Amy Pascal told Vulture: “One of the things about animation that makes it such
                a wonderful thing to work on is that you get to keep going until the story is right.” To the animators
                who said they felt demoralized by revising final renders five times in a row, she added, “I guess,
                welcome to making a movie.” The film which will feature the vocal talents of Shameik Moore, Hailee
                Steinfeld and Oscar Isaac was originally scheduled for a March 2024 release but at the time of writing
                still doesn’t have an official release date.

            <h2>Andrew Garfield Addresses Marvel Future Following Spider-Man 4 Rumours</h2>
            <h3>Greg Evans | Thursday 8 September 2024 07:28</h3>
            <p><img src="andrew garfield.webp" alt="Andrew Garfield" class="float-image-2">
                Andrew Garfield has responded to rumours that he could be involved in a fourth Spider-Man film set in
                the
                Marvel Cinematic Universe alongside Tom Holland and Tobey Maguire.

                Garfield, who is currently at the Toronto International Film Festival promoting his new romance film We
                Live in Time with Florence Pugh, was asked about his future as the Marvel web-slinger.

                The 41-year-old actor played Peter Parker in two Amazing Spider-Man movies released between 2012 and
                2014 respectively.

                He then returned as the character in 2021 for Spider-Man: No Way Home which featured all three of the
                live-action Spider-Man actors and became the highest-grossing film of that year.

                In an interview with Gizmodo in July, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige said that a new Spider-Man film is
                in the works, adding: “We have writers who are going to be delivering us a draft relatively soon.” Given
                the success of the previous movie, speculation has naturally developed about who will be in the new
                film. Yet Garfield has been quick to silence his involvement.

                Speaking to Indie Wire he said: “I mean, like the internet is a big place. I think there’s a lot of
                people who will just say anything to get clicks. So you might have been duped, I’m afraid.”

                That being said, Garfield previously stated that he would not be appearing in No Way Home only to appear
                in the finished movie. “I am not [in No Way Home],” the Tick, Tick... Boom! actor told GQ in a 2021
                interview.

                However, the film’s writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers did later reveal that some of the surprise
                actors in the movie did not sign on until halfway through filming.

                Elsewhere, Jacob Elordi is rumoured to be taking over from Garfield in Guillermo del Toro’s forthcoming
                Frankenstein adaptation for Netflix.

                According to initial reports, the Oscar-winning director was interested in casting Garfield in the
                titular role; however, The Hollywood Reporter has now confirmed that Euphoria breakout Elordi, 26, has
                landed the role.

                He will star alongside Oscar Isaac, Christoph Waltz and All Quiet on the Western Front breakout Felix
                Kammerer in Del Toro’s second feature for the streamer. Mia Goth, Lars Mikkelsen, David Bradley and
                Christian Convery are also set to star. Garfield’s departure from the project apparently came down to
                scheduling conflicts related to last year’s Hollywood writers’ strike, Showbiz411 reported. Aside from
                We Live in Time, the British actor’s next role will be in Challengers and Call Me By Your Name director
                Luca Guadagnino’s thriller After the Hunt.</p>
